## Sprint 4 Documentation

### Overview
During this sprint, we've laid the groundwork for our web application, crafting its fundamental structure and deploying the initial set of components and pages. We've adopted a modular design philosophy to streamline future development and facilitate ongoing maintenance.

### Directory Structure
- **Components Directory**: Stores the building blocks of our application's UI. It includes items like `Groceries`, `GroceryList`, and `RecipeInfoComponent`, each encapsulating distinct functionalities.
- **Pages Directory**: Contains the different views presented to the user. The current set includes `About_Us_Page`, `Landing_Page`, `Our_Journey_Page`, `Recipe_Details_Page`, and `Recipe_Instructions_Mobile` among others, each serving a unique purpose within the app.
- **__test__ Directory**: Hosts our Jest test files, with each file corresponding to a component or page in the application, ensuring robustness and reliability through comprehensive testing.

### Key Components
- **Recipe Component**: Facilitates the exploration of various recipes with a dropdown interface.
- **Landing Page**: The gateway to our application, showcasing the `Recipe` component and the app's title for a welcoming user experience.

### Running the Application
To launch the app locally:

1. **Pre-requisites**:
   - Have `Node.js` and `npm` installed to run the app and manage its dependencies.
   - Obtain Node.js and npm from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) if not already installed.

2. **Setup**:
   - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. **Installation**:
   - Execute `npm install` to install dependencies, crucial for the initial setup.

4. **Launching the App**:
   - Post-installation, run the app with `npm start`.
   - It should open in your default web browser, or manually go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Testing
- Run tests via `npm test` in the terminal within the project directory.
- Tests assure component integrity and application functionality, with each `__test__` file detailing the specific application aspect it's verifying.

### Images and CSS
- **Images Directory**: Contains graphical assets used throughout the application.
- **CSS Files**: Accompanying `.css` files within the `pages` directory ensure that each page has its own stylized layout, enhancing the user interface.

### Continuous Integration and Docker Support
- **Dockerfile**: Provided for containerizing the application, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Build Directory**: Generated post-build and used for deployment.

Remember to keep your documentation synchronized with your project's evolution, ensuring that new team members or stakeholders can quickly get up to speed on the application's structure and setup procedures.
